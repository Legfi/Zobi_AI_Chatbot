# Zobi AI Chatbot
## Brief Summary:

This was one of my first projects I've done in NLP and AI. Very easy but intresting poroject there I used BlenderBot 2.0(An open source chatbot that builds long-term memory and searches the internet) and a simple GUI to get a feeling of next generations of chatbots! 

## Clone the repository
Go to a folder of choice and open a terminal that can access git. Write "git clone https://github.com/Legfi/Zobi_AI_Chatbot.git".

Ofcoures you can use github desktop if you wish to clone the repository in a easier way.
## Create a conda environment
If conda is installed with the environment path variables then it should work with only printing. Else open the Anaconda navigator and open a terminal from there.

then type "conda create --name pythonenv python=3.9"
## Update environment with needed packages 
Browse to the git repo folder with the terminal. print "pip install -r requirements.txt"
## Start the python script
Browse to the location of the files.
Then type "flask run" When the script is started the default browser will open at localhost:8501 if it doesn't. Open your preferred browser and browse to "localhost:8501". All done! You can start chatting!
## For trying the Voice version of the app
Browse to the location of the files. make sure that your microphone is activated!
Then type "python Voice_version.py". This will start the app! for closing app just say goodbye! :)
